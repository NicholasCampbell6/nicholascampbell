<h1>Phishing, Flaming, and Spamming</h1>
<p>Phishing is defined by someone who acts as a reputable entity to get someone else to click on a malicious link or download, usually to gain money or personal information. (https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/phishing).
Flaming refers to insults or offensive messages being sent and can be with the intention to anger someone or without (https://techterms.com/definition/flaming). Finally, spam is a bulk of unwanted messages being sent at the same time (https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1716/spam).
	All of these things cause inconvenience or harm to the person who receives it. Depending the messages being sent, spam can lead to phishing. Both phishing and spamming have malicious; while phishing is banned in every states in the US, only some states have outlawed spamming. However, flaming usually does not have as much evil intent as either of the others. While flaming can happen on purpose, it also can be a misunderstanding; which is why choosing your words carefully and trying to clear up confusion is important when talking through text.
